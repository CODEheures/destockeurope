          After more than a year of work to understand business issues wanting to part with 
          their stocks in Europe, we decided to become the facilitator of direct contact from pro to pro.

          '. env('LEGAL_COMPAGNY_PSEUDONAME'). ' allows European companies to destock or to buy and sell 
          objects, series ends, stock purposes. This partnership helps to develop this site of classified 
          ads from professional to professional and allowing the publication of advertisements for the sale 
          of any object to be destocked, these being searchable by all companies without prior registration.
       </p>
       <p>
          The name of the site was chosen from a request from companies not wanting to sell their stock purposes 
          to individuals and willing to sell directly without intermediary.
